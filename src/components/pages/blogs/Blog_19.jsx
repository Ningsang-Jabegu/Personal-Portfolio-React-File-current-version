                                    <p>Responsive design is an approach to web design that makes your web pages look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones). It’s about using HTML and CSS to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen.</p>

                                    <p>With the variety of devices available today, users can access your website from any device with any screen size.

                                        <li><strong>Fluid Grids : </strong>This involves designing the layout of your website using relative units like percentages, rather than fixed units like pixels.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Flexible Images : </strong>Also known as adaptive images, this concept ensures that images on your website are flexible and fit in the layout in a way that enhances user experience.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Media Queries : </strong>These are useful for applying different CSS styles to different devices based on characteristics like screen resolution and orientation.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <br />
