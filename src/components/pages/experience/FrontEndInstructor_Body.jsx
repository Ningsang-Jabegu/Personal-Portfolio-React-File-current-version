                    I have worked as a front-end web instructor at IT Entrepreneur Nepal for three months. By mentoring more than 40 students in those three months, I have gained communication skills, presentation skills, leadership skills, etc.

                    This was my first experience as an instructor, teaching others the basics of web development. For the first few days, I felt it was difficult to run the class, but some days later, I learned how to control the class.
